Kickstarter is full of products of questionable usefulness. You’re going to do some market research, by creating a survey asking for feedback on a product’s features and desirability.

Pick a product on Kickstarter and create a simple survey form for said product. The page should include:

- A title
- An image of your product with an appropriate alt tag
- A link to the Kickstarter page
- A form with questions

The Form should include:

- A Name field
- An Email field
- At least one set of radio buttons
- At least one checkbox
- At least one expandable text area
- At least one non-label element that describes one of these fields

All inputs should have an associated label. 

The entire site should be navigable with keyboard only, and each field should be clearly described when read by a screen reader.

Your site must have no warnings or errors using accessibility validation chrome extension that we looked at in class.

As usual, make a git repository and submit through Ringmaster.
