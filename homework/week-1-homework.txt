Make a new folder called "Web Dev 3 - Week 1 HW", and add a copy of the circus starter to it. Create a git repository with that project and do the following:

- Make sure your include a .gitignore file that lists 'node_modules'

- Commit the default circus starter project with the message 'initial commit'

- Delete the contents of README.md and replace it with '<your name> - Git Homework'

- Use markdown syntax to make your name bold in the readme.

- Delete the contents of the html file and replace it with basic markup that includes your name, your quarter, and a list of three people you would want to have with you during a zombie apocalypse.

- Commit this to the master (default) branch with the message "initial commit".


Next, demonstrate the use of branches

- Make a new branch called 'styling'

- Add some color and font settings to make your html page look a little nicer. Like you would want an 'about me' page on your portfolio to look.

- Commit your changes to the 'styling' branch as you make them. Make sure your commit messages describe what you've done

- Merge those changes back into the main branch


Next, demonstrate how to revert undesired changes. 

- Switch back to your master branch

- Add a horrible mistake to your html file

- Commit that mistake and push

- Then, revert to the previous commit, without rewriting history

- Commit the reverted changes.


Finally, create a pull request in your classmates' repository.

- Post a link to your repository in the slack channel or discussion page on Ringmaster

- Create a fork of your classmates' repositories

- Add to their html file. Say something nice or encouraging

- Submit a pull request for the nice thing you said

- Accept the pull requests that come in for your own project



Submit a link to your repository on ringmaster. I should be able to look through your commit history and see these exact steps carried out.
